# AGENT.md

This file provides guidance to AI Coding Agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Neuron AI is a PHP framework for creating AI agents with features like chat history, tool integration, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), structured output, and workflow orchestration. The codebase follows PSR-12 standards with strict typing and modern PHP 8.1+ features.

## Common Development Commands

### Testing and Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run tests
composer test
# or directly: vendor/bin/phpunit --colors=always

# Run static analysis (PHPStan level 5)
composer analyse
# or directly: vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=1G -v

# Fix code style (PHP CS Fixer with PSR-12)
composer format
# or directly: php-cs-fixer fix --allow-risky=yes

# Refactor code (Rector)
composer refactor
# or directly: vendor/bin/rector

# Install dependencies
composer install
```

### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific test class
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/AgentTest.php

# Run specific test method
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter testMethodName

# Run tests with coverage
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/
```

## Code Architecture

Each module is placed in its own namespace under `src/`. Sub-modules are grouped into sub-namespaces.

### Core Components

**Agent System**: The framework revolves around three main entity types:
- `Agent` (src/Agent.php) - Base agent class with chat, streaming, and structured output capabilities
- `RAG` (src/RAG/RAG.php) - Extends Agent with vector search and document retrieval
- `Workflow` (src/Workflow/Workflow.php) - Node-based execution graphs for complex agentic processes

**Provider Architecture**: Abstracted AI provider system supporting multiple LLM services:
- All providers implement `AIProviderInterface` (src/Providers/AIProviderInterface.php)
- Supported: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, HuggingFace, Mistral, Grok
- Each provider has its own MessageMapper for API-specific formatting

**Tool System**: Extensible tool framework for agent capabilities:
- Individual tools implement `ToolInterface` (src/Tools/ToolInterface.php)
- Toolkits group related tools (src/Tools/Toolkits/)
- Built-in toolkits: Calculator, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Tavily, Zep, AWS SES, Jina, Riza, Supadata

**RAG Components**:
- Vector stores: Support for Pinecone, Chroma, Elasticsearch, Qdrant, Typesense, and more
- Embeddings providers: OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Voyage
- Document loaders: PDF, HTML, text files with chunking strategies
- Pre/post processors for query transformation and document reranking

**Chat History**: Pluggable memory systems (InMemory, File, SQL-based)

**Structured Output**: JSON schema-based extraction with PHP class mapping using attributes

**MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol server connector for external tool integration

### Key Traits and Patterns

The codebase uses PHP traits extensively for modular functionality:
- `StaticConstructor` - Provides `make()` static factory method
- `Observable` - Observer pattern implementation for monitoring
- `ResolveProvider`, `ResolveTools`, `ResolveChatHistory` - Dependency resolution

All major components support the Observer pattern for monitoring and debugging, integrating with Inspector APM.

### Directory Structure

- `src/` - Main source code with PSR-4 autoloading under `NeuronAI\` namespace
- `src/Providers/` - AI provider implementations
- `src/Tools/` - Tool system and built-in toolkits
- `src/RAG/` - RAG system components
- `src/Workflow/` - Workflow orchestration system
- `src/Chat/` - Chat messaging and history management
- `src/Observability/` - Monitoring and event system
- `tests/` - PHPUnit tests mirroring src/ structure

## Code Standards

- Strict typing enforced (`declare(strict_types=1)`)
- PSR-12 coding standard
- PHPStan level 5 static analysis
- 100% type coverage requirements (return, param, property)
- All classes use constructor property promotion where applicable
- Extensive use of PHP 8.1+ features (enums, readonly properties, etc.)

## Environment Variables

Key environment variables for development:
- `INSPECTOR_INGESTION_KEY` - For monitoring/observability
- Various provider API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
- Database connection strings for vector store testing
